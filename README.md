## Project objectives and goals 
The goal of this project is to build a habit-tracking website that helps users build and 
maintain positive habits through consistent tracking, reminders, and data visualization.

encouragement and motivation. This is important because many people struggle with 
consistency.   
● Help users build and maintain positive habits through simple tracking and 
motivation.

and reminders.   
● Offer customization to build different habits.
